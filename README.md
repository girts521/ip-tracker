An ip tracker which shows your ip and location. Also you can enter a different ip address is domain name to see its location and information. 

I used https://geo.ipify.org/ api to get the ip data and https://leafletjs.com/ to display a map. 

This was part of the Intermediate IP Address Tracker challange available on https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0

The challenge provides the idea and some design files. It was a good practice and a fun project.
